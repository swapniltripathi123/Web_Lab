<h1>What is Version Control</h1>
<p>What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so
that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, 
though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
</p><br>
<h2>Why we use version control</h2>
<p>If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is 
a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, 
see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally
means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.</p>
<h2>Three Commands we use </h2>
<h4>Git Push</h4>
<p>The git push command is used to transfer or push the commit, which is made on a local branch in your computer to a remote repository like GitHub. The
command used for pushing to GitHub is given below.
git push 'remote_name' 'branch_name'<p>
<h4>Git Clone</h4>
<p>You can clone a repository from GitHub to your local computer to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits. When 
you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder 
for the project. You can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub, or pull other people's changes from GitHub. For more information, see "Using common Git commands".
</p>
<h4>Git Fork</h4>
<p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>
